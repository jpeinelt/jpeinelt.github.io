I currently work through the book [Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation][plai-book].
It uses Racket as a implementation language and teaches you a lot about interpretation (hence the name)
of programming languages. So if your interested how stuff works, I would say that this is the best introductory
text I found so far. The examples are somewhat easy to follow, the explanations are clearly written. Overall I
like the sometimes witty style of the book.

If you never saw one line of Scheme, Lisp or Racket I encourage you to download [Racket][racket] and follow the
first two chapters of the [Guide][racket-guide]. Or buy the 'Little Schemer' books.
After a while you will probably fall in love with language from the LISP family.
I at least enjoy writing Racket code a lot even if I didn't write that much yet. The only downside is
the not so great syntax coloring and keybindings of DrRacket although if you used Emacs many bindings will feel familiar.
